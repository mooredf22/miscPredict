Description: The 'miscPredict' package takes a proposed protein signature, 
   produces a
   predictive model using the support vector machine method, and evaluates 
   the resulting model's ability to distinguish MIS-C from the other 
   disease types. The evaluationincludes overall error, sensitivity, 
   specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The model is built
   using data on the 
   relative abundance of 1391 proteins in serum samples for 19 MIS-C 
   patients and 40 patients divided among Kawasaki (13patients), 
   pneumonia (17 patients), and 
   asymptomatic (10 patients).
